Machine Learning Web Site is intuitive and user-friendly. I created it using the ``Django Rest Framework``.

The program learns from the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pplonski/datasets-for-start/master/adult/data.csv database.

It uses **Random Forest** and **Extra Trees** algorithms for prediction.
It also has **AB tests** that validate the algorithms.
